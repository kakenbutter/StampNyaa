## 🎨 Add Your Own Stickers

StampNyaa supports adding your own sticker packs to the app.

- Simply add a folder to the `stickers` directory in the app's sticker folder, which is located in your `{user}/Pictures` folder by default.
- The folder name will be used as the sticker pack name by default, and the images inside will be used as the stickers.
- You will also need to add a sticker named `main.png` to be used as the icon representing the sticker pack in the sidebar.
- Note that only `.png` images are currently supported.
- After adding new stickers to your `stickers` directory, press `Ctrl/Command+R` in the app to refresh and your newly added stickers should show up.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- macOS users will need to grant the app accessibility permissions for some functions.
- Autoupdate does not work on macOS nor Linux.
> [!WARNING]
> For **macOS users**, you must enable accessibility features for the app to automatically press Command+V to paste stickers. It should prompt you to enable this the first time you try to paste a sticker, but if it doesn't, you can [enable it manually](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-accessibility-apps-to-access-your-mac-mh43185/mac). To do this, go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility` and check the box next to StampNyaa.

## 🤝 Acknowledgements & Contribution

This app would not exist if it were not for jeffshee's **[LINEStickerKeyboard](https://github.com/jeffshee/LINEStickerKeyboard/)** Android app which I use frequently, inspiring me to build StampNyaa for desktop.

Many thanks go to the original creator [MarvNC](https://github.com/MarvNC), as this fork would certainly not exist without the extensive work they put into this app.
